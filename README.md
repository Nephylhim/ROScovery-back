# ROScovery-back

ROScovery is a school project with ROS and turtlebots. Turtlebots will be placed in the school and will need to discover the place, draw a map and send it to a server (ROScovery-back). This server will aggregate datas from all turtlebots and will try to connect maps. If two maps are connected, this new map will be send to turtlebots.
